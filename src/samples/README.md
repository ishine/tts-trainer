# Input Sample Instructions

This folder is where all of your input samples will go.

For each speaker, create a separate folder with the speaker name as the directory name. For example, if we have a speaker `LJ001`, the entire directory path would look like `samples/LJ001/LJ001_1.wav`.

You do not have to change the names of your audio files. As long as you place them in the correct directory, they will be processed properly.

**Currently, only WAV and MP3 files have been tested**. Librosa is used to load audio, so feel free to research their supported file formats.
